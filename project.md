This project is for the ethrome hackathon.

Here's the targetted bounties:
## ENS - $5.000

### **What is** ENS

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain.
ENS‚Äôs job is to map human-readable names like ‚Äòalice.eth‚Äô to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses, other cryptocurrency addresses, content hashes, and metadata. ENS also supports ‚Äòreverse resolution‚Äô, making it possible to associate metadata such as canonical names or interface descriptions with Ethereum addresses.

**Documentation**: [https://docs.ens.domains](https://docs.ens.domains/)

### Prize Details

$2k - Best use of ENS, 1st place

$1k - Best use of ENS, 2nd place

$2k - Pool prize, build anything and integrate ENS

## BuidlGuidl - $2.000

BuidlGuidl is a curated group of Ethereum builders creating products, prototypes, and tutorials to enrich the Web3 ecosystem. BuidlGuidl developed and supports Scaffold-ETH.

[Scaffold-ETH](https://scaffoldeth.io/) is an open-source, toolkit for building dapps on EVM chains. It's designed to make it easier for developers to build and iterate over your smart contracts and frontends quickly. Scaffold-ETH is a great stack progressing from rapid prototyping to production.

### **Bounties description**

Top 2 dapps built using [Scaffold-ETH](https://scaffoldeth.io/) - $1000 each (equivalent in mainnet ETH)

Submissions will be judged based on technical complexity and completeness, ecosystem impact, readMe effectiveness, and innovation.

## Base 
Stretch goal -- I've already made a mini app before in v0 so I am more aware of how mini apps work

## Base - $5.000

Base is an open stack built to empower builders, creators, and people everywhere to build apps, grow businesses, create what they love, and earn onchain.

The three parts of the Base stack work together to support the future of an open, global economy for everyone:

- **Base Chain**: An open network for the global economy. Formerly just ‚ÄúBase,‚Äù the secure, fast, and low-cost Ethereum L2, built on the Superchain empowering a global onchain economy at scale. With Flashblocks, we‚Äôre reducing effective block times from 2 seconds to just 200 milliseconds, making Base Chain 10x faster. [Learn more](https://www.base.org/).
- **Base Build**: Our continued commitment to fostering a vibrant builder ecosystem at [base.org/build](http://base.org/build). Base Build will continue to provide builders with the tools and support they need to create the next wave of onchain experiences. This includes the new [Base Build dashboard](http://base.dev/) that help teams build, grow, and monetize their mini apps.
- **Base App**: Your new home, onchain. Built on open protocols, the next evolution of Coinbase Wallet is more than a wallet, it‚Äôs where you create, earn, trade, discover apps and chat with friends all in one place. The next version is in beta now. Join the waitlist at [base.app](https://base.app/).

*If you need a **code** to **skip the waitlist**, make sure to come to our booth!*

### **Miniapps**

The next evolution of digital experiences extends beyond app stores into social feeds and direct messages. Mini Apps are lightweight, social-native apps that launch instantly when you tap them: no downloads, no friction, just immediate engagement. While the Base App provides the discoverability through social distribution and featured listings, Mini Apps deliver the frictionless experience that makes instant trial and viral sharing possible.

Create mini apps that help local businesses get onchain. Whether it's accepting payments, managing loyalty programs, handling inventory, or connecting with customers, build mini apps that solve real problems for small business owners. Make crypto useful for the corner store, the local cafe, or the neighborhood salon.

**What We're Looking For:**

- Payment acceptance mini apps
- Loyalty and rewards program mini apps
- Customer engagement tools
- Inventory or booking management mini apps
- QR code based transaction solutions
- Solutions that work for non-technical users

## Hackaton idea.

Use ENS to alias Google A2A agent capabilities and launch an agent.
For example, I own ballew.eth. As subdomains:
myagent1.ballew.eth - this is an agent that does something like defi
myagent2.ballew.eth - this is an agent that is good at red teaming

There would be a contract that would acept payment or some sort of subscription for launching an agent with those capabilities and taking input. I was considering ElizaOS for this but if there is an easy way to do this with farcaster.xyz with or without a base mini app, that's even better.

For agent capabilities .well-known, this would just be stored on github or s3 since there are no ipfs bounties in this hackathon.

For reference, these are all the bounties:
https://ethrome25.notion.site/Prizes-and-Bounties-160d00c099af81aba88cd436e7acf94f

And of course this will be on the AI track.

I have 39 hours to do this and am working solo. I'm familier with devops and AI agents but my smart contract knowledge is basic.
