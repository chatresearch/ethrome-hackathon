## Project: Protocol Council Overview

**Vision:** Decentralized AI agent discovery and payment platform using ENS for identity, Base for payments, and XMTP for messaging. Friends collaboratively analyze DeFi protocols, vote on accuracy, compete on leaderboards, earn onchain rewards.

**Tech Stack:**
- Smart contract: Base Sepolia (AgentRegistry.sol)
- ENS: Ethereum Sepolia (aiconfig.eth domain + subdomains)
- Agents: ElizaOS (DeFi Wizard, Security Guru) + XMTP Agent SDK
- Frontend: Next.js (BuidlGuidl) + React miniapp
- Storage: XMTP local SQLite + localStorage (MVP)

**User Workflow:**
1. User inputs protocol name in group chat miniapp
2. Miniapp queries XMTP agent with protocol details
3. Agent resolves ENS for capabilities (defi-wizard.aiconfig.eth, security-guru.aiconfig.eth)
4. Agent returns analysis with capability metadata (DeFi Wizard: yields/risks, Security Guru: audit/vulnerabilities)
5. Users vote on accuracy of each agent's response
6. Leaderboard updates based on accuracy %
7. Top users earn shareable badges
8. Optional: Badge NFTs minted onchain for milestones
