# Testing Requirements for eth-ai-asa

## Smart Contract Changes

After ANY changes to `packages/foundry/contracts/` or `packages/foundry/script/`, you MUST:

1. **Run the full test suite:**
   ```bash
   cd packages/foundry && forge test -v
   ```

2. **Verify all tests pass** before completing the task
   - Expected: "19 passed; 0 failed"
   - If any tests fail, fix the code immediately

3. **Check gas usage** in the test output
   - Look for unusually high gas costs
   - Consider optimizations if gas > 500k for a single operation

## Frontend Changes

After changes to `packages/nextjs/`, verify:

1. **No linting errors:**
   ```bash
   cd packages/nextjs && yarn next:lint
   ```

2. **The dev server still runs:**
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

3. **Page loads without errors** (http://localhost:3001/agents)

## ElizaOS Agent Changes

After ANY changes to `agent-marketplace/src/` (character files, plugins, etc.), you MUST:

1. **Run unit tests for agents:**
   ```bash
   cd agent-marketplace && bun test src/__tests__/defi-wizard.test.ts src/__tests__/security-guru.test.ts
   ```

2. **Verify all tests pass** before completing the task
   - Expected: "25 pass, 0 fail" with 100% coverage
   - Tests validate: name, fields, prompts, topics, plugins, message examples, styles

3. **Rebuild the project:**
   ```bash
   cd agent-marketplace && npm run build
   ```

4. **Verify agents still load correctly:**
   - Run `npm start` and check that both agents initialize
   - Expected output: "Started 2/2 project agents" (or more if adding agents)
   - Both agents should respond to test queries in the UI

5. **Optional: Run E2E integration tests** (slower, ~2-5 minutes):
   ```bash
   npm start  # in one terminal
   npx cypress run --spec "src/__tests__/cypress/e2e/multi-agent.cy.ts"  # in another
   ```

### Character File Requirements

When modifying agent character files (TypeScript or JSON), ensure:
- ✅ Must be **TypeScript files (.ts)** not JSON - JSON files don't load properly
- ✅ Export the character with correct name (`export const characterName: Character`)
- ✅ Include `messageExamples` with domain-specific examples
- ✅ Include `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` in plugins list
- ✅ Include `@elizaos/plugin-sql` and `@elizaos/plugin-openai` at minimum
- ✅ System prompt should be domain-specific, not generic
- ✅ Topics and bio should match agent expertise

## General Rules

- ❌ **Never skip tests** - They validate agent and contract behavior
- ✅ **Always run tests** after changes to agents or contracts
- ✅ **Read the test output** - Look for failures or regressions
- ✅ **Fix failures immediately** - Don't move on until tests pass
- ✅ **Use TypeScript for character files** - Not JSON or JavaScript

## Test Command Reference

```bash
# ElizaOS Agent Tests
cd agent-marketplace

# Unit tests only (fast - ~20ms)
bun test src/__tests__/defi-wizard.test.ts src/__tests__/security-guru.test.ts

# Build the project
npm run build

# Start the server
npm start

# E2E tests (slower - ~2-5 minutes)
npx cypress run --spec "src/__tests__/cypress/e2e/multi-agent.cy.ts"
npx cypress open  # Interactive mode

# Smart Contract Tests
cd packages/foundry && forge test -v

# Quick test (no verbose output)
forge test

# Run specific test
forge test --match test_QueryAgent_Success

# Run with detailed trace
forge test -vv

# Watch mode (auto-rerun on changes)
forge test --watch
```
