## Key Configuration Notes

### Important: Encryption Key Format
⚠️ **XMTP_WALLET_KEY** requires `0x` prefix  
⚠️ **XMTP_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY** must NOT have `0x` prefix

### Backup Recommendations
🔐 **Back up these files immediately:**
- `.env` file (contains encryption keys)
- `xmtp_db/` directory (message history)

**Losing the encryption key means losing access to message history!**

## Known Warnings (Non-Critical)

### Installation Limit Warning
```
[WARNING] You have "2" installations. Installation ID "5e3578..." is the most recent.
```

**Meaning:** XMTP tracks agent installations to prevent abuse.  
**Action Required:** None currently (limit is typically 10 installations).

## Support

### Logs
Development logs: Console output  
Production logs: Configure logging destination

### Debugging
```bash
# Check agent status
ps aux | grep "tsx src/index.ts"

# View test output
npm run test:watch

# Check environment
cat .env
```

### Common Issues
1. **"Non-base16 character"** → Check XMTP_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY has no `0x` prefix
2. **"XMTP_WALLET_KEY env is not in hex format"** → Add `0x` prefix to XMTP_WALLET_KEY
3. **"Property 'content' does not exist"** → Use `ctx.message.content` instead

**STATUS: READY FOR DEVELOPMENT** 🚀

All systems operational. Agent is ready for ENS integration and ElizaOS connection.
